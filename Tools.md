# Scientific softwares and coding languages

* Matlab: convenient if your institution has an account
* [Octave][octave] (Free, similar to Matlab) 
* Python 

Audio files can be edited using scientific softwares, which is convenient to perform analysis calculations, to plot the spectrum or the time signal, to apply some functions, etc.  
So in a scientist point of view this may be a valid option.
However, if interested only on music, sound design, or other studio application, other sofwares are specifically designed for this purpose.  

# Audio signal editors

* [Audacity][Audacity] : the simplest to install and to use to edit audio wavefiles 
* Reaper : avanced studio software
* Ardour : alternative to Reaper
* Alternatives: protools, cubase, logic, ...

These softwave are good options when editing audio files as time-amplitude signals. They may offer spectrum and spectrogram analysis.  
However, dedicated programs and scientific tools are more convenient to analyse the spectrum.

#  Signal processing, spectrum analysis 

To analyse the spectrum, alternatively to scientific tools that needs some coding skills, these sofwares are good options to consider to perform spectral analysis efficiently

* [Sonic Visualizer][SonicVisualiser]
* [Praat][Praat]
* [Audiosculpt][Audiosculpt] (IRCAM)

# Audio programming language / Music 

* [FAUST][FAUST] (GRAME)
* puredata 
* csound 
* Max MSP (IRCAM)
* [Antescofo][Antescofo] 
* supercollider
* [chuck][chuck]
